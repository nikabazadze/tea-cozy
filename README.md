# Tea Cozy
This is the Tea Cozy project from the Codecademy's Full-Stack Engineering course.

## Overview
For this project, I was provided with a design spec and image assets to build the web page. The main goal for this project is to practice Layout with CSS Flexbox. Apart from this, I was able to practice more CSS Position properties with different values.
